# Shadow Casting Demonstration

This repo contains several versions of a
[shadow casting](http://www.roguebasin.com/index.php?title=Shadow_casting)
algorithm implemented in Python.

It's the code to go along with a series of articles about shadow casting:

- [Part 1](https://nathanielknight.ca/articles/shadowcasting_part1.html)
- [Part 2](https://nathanielknight.ca/articles/shadowcasting_part2.html)
- [Part 3](https://nathanielknight.ca/articles/shadowcasting_part3.html)

The full version requires [bearlibterminal](http://foo.wyrd.name/en:bearlibterminal) for
interactivity. This can be installed with `pip`, or with [Poetry](https://poetry.eustace.io/)
using the enclosed `pyproject.toml` file.
